## AMSI Scanner

A C/C++ implementation of Microsoft's Antimalware Scan Interface.

## Requirements

Before you compile, there are a couple of things needed, such as the ```amsi.h``` header
file, and ```amsi.lib```. This repository includes all that, but in case you are curious
where they can be found, you can go ahead and download the Windows 10 SDK:

https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk

And then you will be able to find the header file in this location:

```C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.16299.0\um\amsi.h```

The ```amsi.lib``` file is shipped in two versions, x64 and x86:

* ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.16299.0\um\x86\amsi.lib```
* ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.16299.0\um\x64\amsi.lib```

## Compiling

To compile, download Visual Studio (I used VS 2013, because Metasploit uses this
version to compile Meterpreter):

https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/

Go ahead and open the ```Developer Command Prompt```, and then do this to compile:

```
cl.exe /MT /EHa amsiscanner.cpp
```

And then you will have an executable ```amsiscanner.exe``` binary.

## Usage

To use this tool, simply provide the file name you wish you scan like this:

```
amsiscanner.exe C:\Users\bob\Desktop\example.exe
```

If you don't provide a file name, then ```amsiscanner.exe``` will scan an ```EICAR``` string
(a special string value that is used to test AV engines, but completely harmless).
